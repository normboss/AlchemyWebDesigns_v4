          1. Introspective, Sensitive, Reflective -  You come to grips more frequently and 
          thoroughly with yourself and your environment than do most people. 
          You detest superficiality; you'd rather be alone than have to suffer through 
          small talk. But your relationships with your friends are highly intensive, 
          which gives you the inner tranquility and harmony that you need in order to feel good. 
          However it is no problem for you to be alone for extended periods of time, without becoming bored.

          2. Independent, Unconventional, Unfettered - 
          You demand a free and unattached life for yourself that allows you to determine your own course. 
          You have an artistic bent in your work or leisure activities. Your urge for freedom sometimes causes 
          you to do exactly the opposite of what expected of you. 
          Your lifestyle is highly individualistic. You would never blindly imitate what is in; 
          on the contrary, you seek to live according to your own ideas and convictions, 
          even if this means swimming against the tide.

          You are quite willing to accept certain risks and to make a strong committment 
          in exchange for interesting and varied work. Routine, in contrast, tends to 
          have a paralyzing effect on you.
          What you like most is to be able to play an active role in events. In doing so, 
          your initiative is highly pronounced.

          that which is uncomplicated. People admire you because you have both feet 
          planted firmly on the ground and they can depend on you. You give those who are 
          close to you security and space. You are perceived as being warm and human. 
          You reject everything that is garish and trite. You tend to be skeptical toward 
          the whims of fashion trends. For you, clothing has to be practical and unobtrusively elegant.

          the things in your daily life and tackle them without wavering. You are given a great deal of responsibility at work, 
          because people know that you can be depended upon.

          You are easy-going yet discreet. You make friends effortlessly, yet enjoy your privacy 
          and independence. You like to get away from it all and be alone from time to time 
          to contemplate the meaning of life and enjoy yourself. You need space, so you escape 
          to beautiful hideaways, but you are not a loner. You are at peace with yourself and 
          the world, and you appreciate life and what this world has to offer.

          rational standpoint. What your feelings tell you is just as important to you. 
          In fact, you feel it is important to have dreams in life, too.

          Your momentary sensitivity represents that which is of high quality and durable. 
          Consequently, you like to surround yourself with little gems, which you discover 
          wherever they are overlooked by others.
          Thus, culture plays a special role in your life. You have found your own personal 
          style, which is elegant and exclusive, free from the whims of fashion. 
          Your ideal, upon which you base your life, is cultured pleasure. 
          You value a certain level of culture on the part of the people with whom you associate.
